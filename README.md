# Atom ISP Camera driver for Linux Kernels >= 6.10
This is Atom ISP Camera (Image Signal Processor for camera) DKMS driver for Kernels >= 6.10.

This driver is the original Atom ISP driver from Kernels but converted as DKMS.

Because the kernels are not comming with a precompiled Atom ISP driver, I did this repository to be able to compile as external driver.
